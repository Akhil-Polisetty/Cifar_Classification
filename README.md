# CIFAR Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Neural Network model. The dataset consists of various object classes, and the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the class of a given image. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification tasks in machine learning. This project leverages a Neural Network model to predict the class of images from ten categories. The focus is on robust preprocessing and efficient model architecture.

## Dataset Description
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

### Classes
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

### Dataset Source
The dataset is available at [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Data Preprocessing
Proper data preprocessing is critical for achieving good model performance. The steps include:

### Data Normalization
- Pixel values were scaled to a range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255 to improve model convergence.

### One-Hot Encoding
- The labels were one-hot encoded to represent the classes as binary arrays for compatibility with the model output.

### Data Augmentation
- Applied random transformations to increase dataset variability:
  - **Horizontal Flip**
  - **Random Crop**
  - **Rotation**
  - **Zoom**

### Splitting Data
- The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets to monitor model performance.

## Modeling
### Neural Network Architecture
The model was built using TensorFlow/Keras and consists of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from the images.
2. **Batch Normalization**: Normalize activations to improve training speed and stability.
3. **Max Pooling**: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational load.
4. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Map extracted features to class probabilities.
6. **Softmax Activation**: Output probabilities for each class.

### Hyperparameters
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of ~85% on the test set.
- The model performed best on classes like `Airplane` and `Ship` but had challenges distinguishing similar classes like `Cat` and `Dog`.


## Future Enhancements
- Experimenting with advanced architectures like ResNet and DenseNet.
- Implementing transfer learning for improved performance.
- Deploying the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
- Visualizing intermediate layer outputs for better interpretability.
